                    <p>An NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplace allows users to purchase, sell, and exchange digital assets represented by NFTs. 
                        NFTs are distinct digital tokens that are frequently used to indicate ownership or authenticity of digital goods 
                        like art, music, films, virtual real estate, collectibles, and so on. In an NFT marketplace, 
                        creators convert their digital works into NFTs and attach information defining their uniqueness and ownership rights. 
                        These NFTs are then placed on the market for sale or auction. Buyers may explore the ads, make bids, 
                        and buy NFTs with cryptocurrency, usually Ethereum or other blockchain-based currencies. 
                        This platform was designed primarily for graphic designers in the Bicol Region but may also be used 
                        to trade outside of the region. This platform was created to support a student's undergraduate research.
